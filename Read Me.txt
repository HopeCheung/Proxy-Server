Proxy Instruction

1. To start the proxy service, you should run following instruction in your terminal:

   python ProxyServer 127.0.0.1


2. The port number used in the proxy is 8888. So, you can open your browser and type the website you want to visit:
   
   127.0.0.1:8888/www.google.com


3. The data structure is as follows:

   (1) When there is a "/" in the filename, you will build a directory, and save the file in the directory.
   	   For example, if the filename is a/b/c.txt, you will first build directory a, then build sub-directory b, and store the c.txt in the b directory;

   (2) When there is not "/" in the filename, the file will be stored directly in the same folder as the ProxyServer.py 


4. Error handling: when meeting unavailable request file, the proxy will respond with "404 Not Found" file. There is a file called index.html, which is a simple "Not Found" website. This HTML file will send to the client when "404 Not Found" happens.


5. Cache Update: when the file in the cache is modified, the files will be updated to the newest version.  


Bonus:

6. Save headers:the headers received from client will be stored, and use them to maek request to server when necessary.


7. Multi-thread: the proxy supports multi-thread functionality, which can handle multiple requests at the same time. The target function is handler(), each time call handler(), the new thead will start


8. Each functionality is made into function, which can be readable and elegant.
